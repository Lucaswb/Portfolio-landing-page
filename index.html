                  <h3>About me:</h3>
                    <p>I was born in Boston MA, to a French mom and American dad. At 9 years old I moved to a town in the outskirts of Chicago. At 16 I again moved to Woodinville Highschool where I joined the football and wrestling team. Thoughout my childhood, I'd visit my grandparents in France each summer where I learned to speak french. I graduated Highschool in 2013 and took a year up in Bellingham before transfering to UW in the fall of 2014 where I majored in Comprehensive Physics. I graduated in 2018 and spent an additional 6 months afterwards in Montpellier, a city located on the Mediterranean close to the Spanish-French Border. I came back at the end of the year and took my LSATS in April. Afterwards I decided that, even though I want to eventually move into law, having a firm grasp of computer programming would be essential for almost any high end career, its for this reason I decided to attend Epicodus.</p>
